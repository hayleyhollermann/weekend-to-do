# Weekend To-Do List

## Description
*Duration: Weekend Project*

The user interface includes an input field to add a task. Once added, the task will be listed in the table below, and stored in the database. Each task in the table has a "delete" option as well as a check box for once the task is completed. If the completed box is checked, the text style of that task changes. These changes and deletions are also reflected in the database.
